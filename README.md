 # **How I made my puppet for the Newcastle Puppetry Festival**
I started out with a prototype which was A cardboard box with A slit in it, with a hand made out of cardboard like this.

It had a BBC micro:bit with code written in Microsoft make code to Record how much force is exerted on the hand to shake it for a proof of concept.

Following on from that prototype.  At the next coderdojo Gateshead session. I moved onto a wooden model of a hand, at that session I realised that people who shake the hand would  exert different forces onto the hand when they shake it, so I found a simpler solution of detecting when a circuit is complete  and I had also decided I wanted it to speak, so I moved the project in to the programming language python for the BBC micro:bit and I moved it into a different housing unit, a converted box-file, with a Hole to screw the hand onto and a piece of elastic to stop the hand from falling down and a speaker with lights which I got free with three cans of Pringles attached on the top with some sticky tack which look like this.
