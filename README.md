 # **How I made my puppet for the Newcastle puppetry festival**
I started out with a cardboard box with A slit in it with a hand made out of cardboard like this.

And then started out with code written in Microsoft make code to Record how much force is exerted on the hand to shake it for a proof of concept.

Following on from that proof of concept  at the next coderdojo Gateshead session I moved onto a wooden model of a hand, at that session I realised that people who shake the hand would  exert different forces onto the hand when they shake it, so I found a simpler solution of detecting when a circuit is Complete  and I had also decided I wanted it to speak, so I moved the project in to the programming language python for the BBC micro:bit and I moved it into a different housing unit a converted box-file with a Hole to screw the hand onto and a piece of elastic to stop the hand from falling down and a speaker with lights which I got free with three cans of Pringles attached on the top with some sticky tack which look like this.
